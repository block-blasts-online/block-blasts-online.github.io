                <p class="mb-4">We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children's use of online activities regularly. This is why we created a separate age-appropriate experience for Children Users through the Block-Blast-Online.github.io Kids Site, or through an age-gate in certain games on the Block-Blast-Online.github.io General Site: in order to comply with the legislation, you could be presented to an age screen when starting the game. When presented with this age screen, it is important that you state the correct age. Based on your age information and your device settings, Block-Blast-Online.github.io does not process personal data of children under the minimum age limit (Children Users) that is prescribed by the legislation in the individual jurisdictions for behavioral advertisement.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">Block-Blast-Online.github.io makes certain choices available to you when it comes to your personal data. Please review the below information outlining your choices and how to exercise them. We will respond to all requests within a reasonable timeframe. If our full response will ever take more than a month due to complexity or scope, we will notify you of this and keep you updated. We may request more information to confirm your identity before acting on any request.</p>
        
                <div class="mb-4">
                    <p class="font-bold">Delete your data: </p>
                    <p>You also hold the right to have your personal data deleted. This is sometimes known as the 'right to be forgotten'. To request that we delete all personal data about you, please submit a request using the contact information at the end of this section.</p>
                </div>
        
                <p class="mb-4">After you delete your personal data from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not immediately remove data from our backup systems for archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so. We may also decline to honor this request in certain specific situations, such as if the data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or to exercise/defend a legal claim.</p>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    <p class="font-bold">Restrict Processing: </p>
                    <p>You have the right to restrict how we process your personal data in certain circumstances. This is an alternative to requesting the deletion of your data. Rather than requesting we delete all of your personal data, you may request that we limit our uses of your personal data to specific purposes. You may wish to request we restrict our processing if you contest the accuracy of your personal data and we are working to verify this information, or if you want us to retain your personal data in connection to a legal claim but cease processing it.</p>

                    <p class="font-bold">Right to Object: </p>
                    <p>You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes or when our processing of your data is based on legitimate interests. You may request that we stop processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. This is an absolute right and we cannot refuse this request. Beyond direct marketing, if you wish to exercise this right, you must give specific reasons why you object to our processing of your data, based on your particular situation. Even after receiving such a request, we may continue processing if it is necessary for the exercise/defense of a legal claim or if we can demonstrate a compelling legitimate ground for the processing.</p>

                    If any request made under this section is clearly unfounded or excessive, we may reject the request or require a reasonable fee to honor the request. If we decide to reject your request, we will inform you of the reasons for not taking action and provide information on other possible remedies. If we decide that a reasonable fee is necessary, we will promptly inform you and will comply with the request upon receipt of this fee.
