                <p class="mb-6">To truly excel in Block Blast, players should focus on developing a strategic approach to clearing blocks. One effective tip is to keep the game board organized; always try to leave space for larger block shapes, which can help you clear multiple lines at once.

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">How to Think Ahead and Plan Your Moves</h3>
                <p class="mb-6">Strategic thinking is essential in Block Blast, and players who master the art of foresight will undoubtedly improve their scores. To think ahead, you should always consider the upcoming block shapes and how they can fit into your current layout on the grid.
